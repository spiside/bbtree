# BBTree
### A Black and Blue Right Leaning Tree

**BBTree** is a Golang implemented right-leaning variant on the [2014 paper](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/talks/LLRB/LLRB.pdf) by Roger Sedgewick on left-leaning red black trees.

## Why?

I was tired of all my nodes leaning left and wanted them to lean right for a change.

## Warning

This is an experimental project and is currently **not** production grade ready. API and performance are subject to change and the tree is not
guaranteed to perform correctly with high levels of volume. Use at your own risk.
